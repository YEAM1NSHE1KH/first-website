            <p>Hi, I'm Yeamin. We met at the Dhaka Commerce College last week. I work in front end devoloping and have a
                keen interest in competitive programming. I heard you're also exploring new strategies in that field.
                It's
                nice to finally connect!.I'm very determined to learn from you, my friend Dinar. I've seen your
                excellent
                programming skills and your ability to understand the logic behind any problem. If you could teach me,
                I'd

            <p class="write">On the 15th February 1948, the East Bengal Regiment was raised at Kurmitola, Dhaka under
                the prudent
                leadership of late Major Mohammad Abdul Gani. Until the Great Liberation War of 1971 there were 8
                battalions of the East Bengal Regiment with their remarkable achievements. On night 25 March 1971
                Pakistan Army brutally killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Bangali civilians and uniformed
                personnel. As a result, Bengali soldiers in East Pakistan (Bangladesh) revolted and initiated the
                liberation war of Bangladesh in March 1971. In a cabinet meeting of the provisional government of
                Bangladesh held on 11 July 1971, liberation war was structured through dividing the Bangladesh into 11
                sectors and organizing Bangladeshi regular forces more on strategy of small group guerrilla actions.
                Later three regular Infantry Brigades S, K and Z Force were raised to fight conventional
                battles.angladesh Army went through the process of expansion and modernization in all respects with the
                passage of time. Recently Government has adopted long terms expansion and modernization plan of the army
                under ‘Forces Goal 2030’. In the process, two Infantry Division Headquarter and a Composite Brigade
                Headquarters have been raised. Moreover, massive organizational transformation has been carried out in
                many military outfits. Modern weapons and equipments like Main Battle Tank-2000, Radar Controlled Self
                Propelled Gun, FM-90 and Weapon Locating Radar etc have also been incorporated. Infrastructural
                development works and different welfare measures have been taken to upgrade operational efficiency in
                Army.

            <p class="and">The Bangladesh Navy (Bengali: বাংলাদেশ নৌবাহিনী, romanized: Bangladesh Nou Bahini) is the
                naval warfare branch of the Bangladesh Armed Forces, responsible for Bangladesh's 118,813 square
                kilometres (45,874 sq mi) of maritime territorial area, and the defence of important harbours, military
                bases and economic zones.[5] The primary role of the Bangladesh Navy is to protect the country's
                economic and military interests at home and abroad. The Bangladesh navy is also a front line disaster
                management force in Bangladesh, and participates in humanitarian missions abroad. It is a key regional
                player in counter terrorism efforts, and engages in global peacekeeping with the United Nations.The
                Bangladesh Navy was created as part of Bangladesh Forces during Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against
                Pakistan. Its official creation date is July 1971 during the Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference
                1971. In 1971, with West Pakistan imposing a brutal military crackdown in East Pakistan, the Bangladesh
                Liberation War was already underway. Many Bengali sailors and officers in the Pakistan Navy defected to
                form the nascent Bangladesh Navy. Initially, there were two ships, PADMA and PALASH, and 45 navy
                personnel. On 9 November 1971, the first naval fleet, consisting of six small patrol vessels, was
                inaugurated.[9] These ships tried to carry out raids on the Pakistani fleet, but were mistakenly hit and
                sunk by the Indian Air Force on 10 December 1971. The next major attack was launched on Mongla seaport.
                According to official figures from the Bangladesh Navy, a total of 334 sailors were involved with the
                newly created navy, with 22 being killed in action.

            <h2><span class="for">SAVE THE AIR</span></h2>
            <p class="okay">The origin of Bangladesh Air Force (BAF) dates back to 1920 in British India when the
                Indian politicians demanded for inclusion of local people in the Royal Air Force because some members of
                Indian Royal Flying Core had earned name and fame in the 1st World War. The demand eventually got its
                shape in 1932 when Indian Air Force came into being on 08 October of that year. But until 1939 the Royal
                Air force hardly made any progress. Even during the 2nd World War period there was hardly any scope for
                training in the Bangladesh portion of the then sub-continent. However, airports were constructed in
                Comilla, Feni, Patenga, Cox’s Bazar and in few other places hastily. The only recruiting centre for this
                area was in Narayangonj.n aid to civil power, BAF always responded in the best possible way. Bangladesh
                Air Force performed tremendously during deluge like flood in 1988 and after a devastating cyclonic storm
                in Chittagong in 1991. It performed election duties quite successfully in 2001 Parliamentary Election.
                The organization also responded well in international requirements like after earthquake in Gujrat,
                India in 2001; after Tsunami in Sri Lanka and the Maldives in 2004 and after earthquake in Mujaffarabad,
                Pakistan in 2005. It has responded to the call of United Nations by serving under its umbrella in 17
                different war-torn countries of the world.
